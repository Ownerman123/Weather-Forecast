# Weather-Forecast

## Description

As a new developer I wanted to learn about using server side apis. So i made this application using the open weather api. This app takes user input to display a 5 day forecast of any US city. It also saves your search history and makes convinient buttons to click to view a previously viewed location with ease.

## Usage

To check the weather select the US state your city is in then type or select your city from the recomended drop down and click the "See weather" button. To view previous Locations click the button on the left side labeled with the information you wish to see.
